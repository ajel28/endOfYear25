            <h2>Past</h2>
            <p>Mobile gaming has grown into a massive part of the gaming industry, driven by the ubiquity of smartphones and tablets. Devices like the iPhone, high-end Android phones (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S series, ASUS ROG Phone, RedMagic), and tablets like the iPad Pro offer surprisingly powerful hardware with multi-core CPUs and GPUs, high-refresh OLED displays, and generous storage options. Games are accessed through app stores like Google Play, Apple App Store, and increasingly through subscription services like Apple Arcade and Xbox Cloud Gaming. Mobile-exclusive titles like Genshin Impact, Clash Royale, Call of Duty Mobile, and PUBG Mobile showcase the platform's capability, while many traditional console/PC games now have mobile ports or cloud access.</p>

            <h2>Current</h2>
            <p>In 2025, flagship smartphones suitable for gaming range from $800 to $1,400, though you can game on mid-range phones for around $300–$600. Gaming-focused phones often feature shoulder triggers, advanced cooling, and high refresh-rate screens (144Hz+). Devices like the Steam Deck and ASUS ROG Ally blur the line between mobile and PC gaming, while services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and GeForce NOW allow players to stream full console/PC games to their phones using a Bluetooth controller. That said, mobile games are generally designed with touch controls and shorter play sessions in mind, which makes them more accessible to casual players.</p>
                
            <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
            <p>Mobile gaming’s biggest strengths are its convenience, affordability (especially with free-to-play titles), and massive global library. Games are easy to download and play on the go, and mobile devices serve multiple purposes beyond gaming—making them highly efficient for everyday users. However, mobile platforms face limitations in graphics fidelity, control precision, and game depth compared to PCs and consoles. Touch controls can be frustrating in competitive or complex games, and monetization through ads and in-app purchases is often aggressive. Still, for casual gamers, travelers, or those wanting to game without extra gear, mobile devices are the most accessible gaming platform in the world.</p>
