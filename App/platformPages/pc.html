            <h2>Past</h2>
            <p>Unlike consoles, gaming PCs don’t have a single launch date or fixed design. Instead, they’re customizable systems built with components that can be upgraded over time. A gaming PC typically includes a multi-core CPU (from Intel or AMD), a dedicated graphics card (from Nvidia or AMD), fast RAM (16–32 GB is now standard), and an SSD for quick load times. Performance can scale dramatically depending on the hardware, making PCs capable of handling ultra-high resolutions (4K+), high refresh rates (144–240 Hz), and advanced graphics features like ray tracing and AI upscaling. PC platforms like Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG offer massive game libraries, including early access titles, mods, and indie gems often not found on consoles.</p>

            <h2>Current</h2>
            <p>In 2025, gaming PC price points vary widely: entry-level rigs for 1080p gaming can be built or bought for around $800–$1,000, while high-end systems with RTX 4080/4090 GPUs and the latest CPUs (like AMD Ryzen 9 or Intel i9) can easily exceed $2,500–$4,000. Laptops are also an option, with gaming models from ASUS ROG, Alienware, and Lenovo Legion offering powerful mobile performance in the $1,200–$3,000+ range. While PCs offer unmatched flexibility and raw power, the cost of top-tier components has remained high, especially for GPUs and high-refresh displays. Cloud gaming (like NVIDIA GeForce NOW and Xbox Cloud) is also growing in popularity among PC users as a low-hardware alternative.</p>
                
            <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
            <p>The main advantages of PC gaming are customization, superior graphics and performance, a huge range of available games (including mods), and flexibility with peripherals and displays. Backward compatibility is a non-issue—nearly every game from decades ago can still run with some effort. PCs also double as productivity machines, offering unmatched utility beyond gaming. However, the downsides include high up-front costs, maintenance, driver issues, and the lack of standardized experience (not all games are well-optimized for PC). For tech-savvy gamers who want the best visuals and total control over their setup, PCs are hard to beat—but they’re not the simplest or cheapest option.</p>
