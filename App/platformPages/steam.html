            <h2>Past</h2>
            <p>Steam, created by Valve, is the largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming. Launched in 2003, it began as a way to update Half-Life 2, but grew into a full-scale storefront, social hub, and game launcher. Today, Steam offers tens of thousands of games ranging from AAA titles to indie gems, with features like cloud saves, achievements, mod support via the Steam Workshop, and cross-platform play for many titles. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and allows users to organize, customize, and optimize their library through community tools and mods. Valve has also released Steam Deck, a handheld gaming PC that runs SteamOS and plays most of the Steam library on the go.</p>

            <h2>Current</h2>
            <p>Steam itself is free to use, and games vary in price—anywhere from $0 to $70+, with frequent sales like the Steam Summer Sale offering steep discounts. Steam Deck pricing starts around $399 for base models, with higher-end versions reaching $649+. The platform is DRM-locked, meaning games launch through Steam, but many users appreciate its convenience, auto-updates, and broad game support. While Steam is PC-focused, Steam Deck’s popularity has helped bridge the gap between console-style portability and PC power, offering a more console-like user experience for PC gaming on the go.</p>
                
            <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
            <p>Steam’s biggest pros are its huge game selection, regular discounts, mod support, and community-driven features like guides, reviews, and Workshop content. It’s the most flexible and open digital platform in gaming, ideal for both hardcore and casual players. On the downside, Steam lacks the tight ecosystem and polish of closed consoles—issues like hardware compatibility, bugs, and launcher fragmentation can frustrate less tech-savvy users. Also, Steam doesn’t curate quality as strictly as Nintendo or Sony, so browsing can feel overwhelming. Still, for PC gamers, Steam is the go-to platform—and it continues to lead in both content and innovation.</p>
