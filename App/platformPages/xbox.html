            <h2>Past</h2>
            <p>The original Xbox, first teased in March 2000 and officially unveiled in January 2001, marked Microsoft's entry into the gaming console market. The final design evolved from a futuristic chrome prototype into a sleek black box with a signature glowing green “X.” While it looked cool, the Xbox's real strength was under the hood. It featured a 733 MHz Intel Pentium III processor—faster than both the PlayStation 2 and GameCube—and a custom Nvidia GPU capable of rendering up to 125 million polygons per second. It also included a built-in 8 GB hard drive (a first for consoles), 64 MB of unified RAM, a 3D audio processor supporting 256 channels, and broadband Ethernet support for online play via Xbox Live. Microsoft leveraged its software expertise and struck deals with major developers like id Software, Eidos, Capcom, and Namco, producing around 30% of the games in-house. Though it faced stiff competition from Sony’s PS2, the Xbox set the stage for Microsoft’s long-term presence in the gaming industry.</p>

            <h2>Current</h2>
            <p>Fast forward to today, the current-generation consoles—Xbox Series X and Series S—launched in 2020 and remain strong contenders. As of mid-2025, prices have increased: the Series X now costs around $599.99, and the Series S sits at $379.99. The Series X offers high-end performance with true 4K resolution, up to 120 fps gameplay, and 1 TB of fast SSD storage. The Series S, though less powerful, is more affordable and targets 1440p gaming. Microsoft also released a digital-only Series X model at similar price points. Storage expansion is available but expensive, with Seagate’s 4 TB card retailing for $429.99 and the 2 TB version around $219.99–$249.99.</p>
                
            <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
            <p>Pros of the current Xbox line include top-tier hardware, extensive backward compatibility with older Xbox games and accessories, and the popular Quick Resume feature, which allows players to switch between games almost instantly. Xbox Game Pass also offers excellent value, granting access to hundreds of games for a monthly subscription. On the downside, the proprietary storage expansion is pricey, and the lack of standout exclusives compared to PlayStation remains a critique. Nonetheless, Xbox has carved out a powerful ecosystem with a focus on services, performance, and flexibility for gamers.</p>
